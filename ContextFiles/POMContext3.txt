It is a multistep application with the pages for each step displayed just below the "Travel Insurance Plan"
Always make reference to the above url for generating test code, unless I provide or specify some other page.
If using Xpath for locating the element, then make use of the standard parameters in the formula like id, class, name etc, even if they dont work then feel free to write xpath formula which is best according to you.
Run the test script with only one worker and use chromium browser only unless I specify to increase workers or a different browser.
Do run steps one by one using the tools provided by the Playwright MCP, unless I specify to run any particular step.
Only after all steps are completed, emit a Playwright TypeScript test that uses @playwright/test based on message history
Save generated test file in the respective directories, page element file in pages folder and test scenario file in tests folder.
